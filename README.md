The HTTP version of the website redirected to HTTPS with a **301 response**, while the HTTPS version returned a **200 OK response**.

### Observation

The results provide information about the technologies used by the website.

Technology identification can help a security tester understand the potential attack surface. However, identifying a technology or version alone does **not** confirm that the software is vulnerable.

---

## 4.1.3 Nslookup

### Command Used

```bash
nslookup networkwalks.com 8.8.8.8
```

### Result

| Item        | Result          |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| DNS Server  | 8.8.8.8         |
| Resolved IP | 192.232.216.135 |

### Observation

The lookup confirmed the public IP address associated with the domain.

---

## 4.1.4 cURL

### Command Used

```bash
curl -I https://networkwalks.com
```

### HTTP Response

The HTTP response returned:

```text
HTTP/2 200 OK
```

### Important Information Observed

* **X-Endurance-Cache-Level:** `0`
* **X-Nginx-Cache:** `WordPress`
* **WordPress REST API:** `/wp-json/`
* **WordPress Page API:** `/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/53`
* **Cookie:** `__wpdm_client`
* **Cookie Attributes:** Secure and HttpOnly

### Observation

The cURL request showed that server and application-related information was included in the HTTP response.

It also revealed references to the WordPress REST API.

This information may be useful during further authorized enumeration.

---

## 4.1.5 Wafw00f

### Command Used

```bash
wafw00f https://networkwalks.com
```

### Result

```text
The site https://networkwalks.com is behind ModSecurity (SpiderLabs) WAF.
Number of requests: 2
```

### Observation

A **ModSecurity (SpiderLabs) Web Application Firewall (WAF)** was detected in front of the website.

The presence of a WAF provides an additional security layer for filtering and monitoring web traffic.

Detection of a WAF does not independently indicate that a website is either vulnerable or secure.

---

* SPF information
* SRV records
* A records

The BIND version was also disclosed during enumeration.

Such information can be useful during further authorized security assessment because it provides additional information about the underlying infrastructure.

---

# 4.2 Network Scanning With Zenmap

The second phase involved network discovery using **Zenmap**.

The scan was performed against the authorized local network environment.

### Nmap/Zenmap Result

```text
Starting Nmap 7.991 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2026-09-18 20:07 +0100

Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.1

Host is up.

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.31 seconds
```

### Findings

| Finding                   | Result       |
| ------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Target Scanned**        | 192.168.56.1 |
| **Host Status**           | Up           |
| **IP Addresses Scanned**  | 1            |
| **Live Hosts Identified** | 1            |
| **Scan Duration**         | 1.31 seconds |

### Observation

The scan successfully confirmed that the host at **192.168.56.1** was active.

The result represents basic host discovery only. No exploitation or vulnerability testing was performed during this scan.

Because only one IP address was scanned, the result does not provide a complete picture of the entire local network.

A wider authorized network range would be required to identify additional devices.

# 6. Recommendations

## 6.1 Review Publicly Exposed Technology Information

Organizations should review the amount of technology information exposed through web pages, HTTP response headers, DNS records, and other publicly accessible services.

## 6.2 Keep Software Updated

WordPress, plugins, web servers, DNS software, and other infrastructure components should be regularly updated and monitored for security advisories.

## 6.3 Review HTTP Security Headers

HTTP response headers should be reviewed to determine whether unnecessary information is being exposed and whether appropriate security-related headers are configured.

## 6.4 Review DNS Records

Public DNS records should be reviewed regularly to ensure that only necessary records are exposed and that outdated or unnecessary entries are removed.

## 6.5 Properly Configure and Monitor the WAF

The detected ModSecurity WAF should be properly configured, monitored, and regularly reviewed to ensure that it continues to provide effective protection against malicious web traffic.

## 6.6 Perform Regular Internal Network Discovery

Authorized network scans should be performed periodically to identify active hosts and maintain an accurate understanding of the internal network environment.

## 6.7 Investigate Unknown Devices

Any active device discovered on an internal network that is not properly documented or authorized should be investigated by the appropriate network administrator.

## 6.8 Maintain Accurate Network Documentation

Network administrators should maintain updated documentation of authorized hosts, IP addresses, network ranges, servers, and other infrastructure.

## 6.9 Conduct Further Security Testing With Authorization

The findings from reconnaissance and scanning can be used to guide later vulnerability assessment activities.

Any additional testing should remain within the approved scope and authorization.
